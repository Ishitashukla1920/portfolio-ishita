    I've made a couple of games in that language. I also like Golang and Python. Anyway regardless of the language, I just like programming.
    Here is my <a href="https://github.com/Ishitashukla1920" target="_blank">Github</a>!`,
  "cs-degree": `This is my CS degree. I hung it on the wall because I'm proud of it. It was a very theoretical degree but I think it gave me a good foundation.`,
  "sofa-table": `That's my sofa. I like to relax here and unwind with some interesting content.  
  I also enjoy exploring creative projects and sharing my work with others.  
  This portfolio is one of those projects I'm excited about, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it!`,

  Watching experts and creators online is always inspiring and helps me stay motivated.`,

  When inspiration strikes, I make sure to jot it down quickly, or it keeps me up all night!`,
